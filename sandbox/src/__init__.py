'''

Some code used for introduction of quantization in the IBM aihwkit

- utilities.py: Contains some utility functions used in the sandbox code, for example the function to extract experimental data from .mat files
- noise.py: Contains the child classes used for the custom noise injection in the tiles
- plotting.py: Contains the functions to plot the distribution of the weights of the tiles in the model, used specifically to explore the effect of the quantization on the weights of the tiles
- __init__.py: Contains the imports for the sandbox code
- lenet_training.py: Contains the training framework for the LeNet model used as case of study
